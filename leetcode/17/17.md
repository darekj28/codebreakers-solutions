## Motivation
We can easily approach this problem by building every combination of characters by backtracking. Essentially, you are DFSing through the space of all possible combinations.


## Time Complexity: `O(d*4^d)`
The time complexity is `number of digits in the input string` times 4 raised to the `number of digits in the input string`. This is because the `number of possible combinations` is the product of `the number of chars that a digit maps to`. Since the `maximum number of characters a digit can map to` is 4, the number of states in the problem is `4^d` in worst case. For each one of our states, we need to construct the combination, which takes linear time (another `d` computations), so this leads to a time complexity of `O(d*4^d)`
 
## Space Complexity: `O(d*4^d)`
Since there are potentially `4^d combinations` and each combination has length `d`, our space complexity is `O(d*4^d)`.
