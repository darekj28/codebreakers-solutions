## Motivation
Essentially, to solve our problem we want to iterate through each asteroid and:
* check if it crashes into any `asteroids we've already seen`
	* if it does, remove the `smaller asteroids` that would destroyed in our list of `seen asteroids`
	* if the `current asteroid` we are examining is larger than all the other asteroids it would collide into and doesn't get destroyed, add it to our array of `seen asteroids`

Note that a stack is ideal for this situation to keep track of the `asteroids we've already seen` since the `most recently seen asteroids` (that haven't been destroyed) will interact with our `current asteroids`. 

## Time Complexity: `O(n)`
We must visit every cell in the input, so the best we can do is a linear time complexity. In the worst case, every single `asteroid` collides and gets destroyed, resulting in another set of linear operations.  

## Space Complexity: `O(n)`
In worst case, our solution is the size of the input (when none of the asteroids collide), leading us to a linear space complexity of `O(n)`.
