# Motivation
Essentially, to solve our problem we want to iterate through each asteroid and:
* check if it crashes into any `asteroids we've already seen`
	* if it does, remove the `smaller asteroids` that would destroyed in our list of `seen asteroids`
	* if the `current asteroid` we are examining is larger than all the other asteroids it would collide into and doesn't get destroyed, add it to our array of `seen asteroids`

Note that a stack is ideal for this situation to keep track of the `asteroids we've already seen` since the `most recently seen asteroids` (that haven't been destroyed) will interact with our `current asteroids`.
