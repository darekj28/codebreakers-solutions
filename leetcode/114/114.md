## Motivation
We should observe two things about the transformation from a `tree` to a `linked list`:
	1) the left subtree is always ahead in the list
	2) to connect the `list of the left subtree` to the `right subtree`, we need the `last node in the left subtree's linked list`

Because we need the last node (which will be a leaf node), a post order traversal lends itself nicely to this problem. All we have to do is ensure we link the nodes in the proper order.

The order will always be: `root node -> left child -> ...  -> left child list's tail -> right child`

## Run Time Complexity: `O(n)`
We dfs through the tree with a post order traversal, leading to a linear run time.

## Space Complexity: `O(h)`
The recursive call stack becomes the height of the tree in worst case.
