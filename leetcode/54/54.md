## Motivation
The approach we take is very straightforward:
* keep track of the perimeter of the matrix
* loop through the perimeter clockwise and store the values in an array to return

# Time Complexity: `O(n)`
The time complexity is linear to the size of the input since we have to visit every entry in the matrix once to record it into our solution.

# Space Complexity: `O(n)`
The space complexity is linear to the size of the input since our solution contains an entry for each index in the matrix.
