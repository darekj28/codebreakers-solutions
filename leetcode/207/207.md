## Motivation
We can model the courses as a graph, where `node A` points to `node B` if A is a prerequisite of B. 

The only way it wouldn't be possible to finish all courses is in the event that there is a cycle in our graph. For example, if our graph is `A -> B -> C -> A`, it would be impossible to take any of the courses.

We can solve this problem by creating a graph based on the course dependencies and DFSing through the graph. If we detect a cycle (encounter an `ancestor` of `a node we're currently visiting`), then we know it isn't possible to complete the courses.

## Time Complexity: `O(n)`
DFS involves visiting all nodes in the graph a constant number of times, leading to a linear time complexity of `O(n)`.

## Space Complexity: `O(n)`
DFS involves a recursive call stack that can grow to the size of the `number of nodes in the graph`, leading to a linear space complexity of `O(n)`.
