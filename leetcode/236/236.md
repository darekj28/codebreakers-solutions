## Motivation
The problem lends itself to recursion, like most tree problems. Since we want the lowest common ancestor, we'll want to work from the bottom of the tree at the leaf nodes and work our way up. Due to this, a postorder traversal works nicely with the following approach:
* check if the nodes `p`, `q` have been found under the current node's children 
	* if so, if the `LCA` __has not__ been found, store the current node as the `LCA`
	* else: return and undo the recursive call stack

# Time Complexity: `O(n)`
The time complexity is linear to the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, we have to traverse through every node if p or q isn't in the tree. If they are guaranteed to be in the tree, then the worst case is when one of them is the leftmost child and the other is the rightmost child.

# Space Complexity: `O(h)`
The space complexity is linear to the `height of the tree`, for the recursive call stack. If the tree is balanced, then the height of the tree will be `log(n)`. For unbalanced trees, the height can be equal to the number of nodes, leading to a linear time complexity of `O(n)`.
