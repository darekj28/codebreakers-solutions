#Motivation
The `volume of water` contained by two `vertical lines` is defined by the `height of the vertical lines` and the `length between the two vertical lines`. Note that the `volume of water that will be contained` is limited by the `height of the shorter vertical line`. 

Given this, it is helpful to approach this problem by working from the outer bounds of the `input array` and working towards the center. By maximizing the `distance between the two vertical lines` we ensure that we are finding the `maximum volume` that could be held by the `shorter vertical line`. 

Since the `shorter vertical line` is the limiting factor in the `amount of volume contained`, we update the index of the `shorter vertical line` once we've computed the `max volume that could be contained with it`. 

We can keep track of the `max volume contained` as we iterate towards the center of the `input array` and return it once we finish.
