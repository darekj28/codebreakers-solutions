## Motivation
We take a straightforward approach:
	* keep track of the `sign` of the `input integer`
	* cast the `abs(input integer)` to a string
	* reverse the `characters` in the string in a `stringbuilder` (we use a queue to accomplish this)
	* convert the `stringbuilder` into an integer with the correct `sign`
	* check that our new integer is within the bounds of a 32 bit signed integer before returning a value

## Time Complexity: `O(1)`
The time complexity is constant since there's a finite number of `digits in the input integer` we iterate through. Since our input is within the bounds of a 32 bit signed integer, we will never have more than 11 characters to loop through. 

## Space Complexity: `O(1)`
Similarly, the amount of space we need for our stringbuilder will never exceed 11 elements, so our space complexity is also constant.
