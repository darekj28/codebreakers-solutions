## Motivation
The solution for `numDecodings(s)` can be broken down to overlapping subproblems, making dp the perfect approach for this problem. 

We can break the problem down into the following cases:
* if the `current digit` is between 1 and 9, we can construct `numDecodings(s-1) codes` by appending the `code for the one digit number` to the `list of codes creatable for string s[:i-1]`
* if the `last two digits` are between 10 and 26, we can construct `numDecodings(s-2) codes` by appending the `code for the two digit number` to the `list of codes creatable for string s[:i-2]`

By looping through the `input string` and applying these rules, we can construct the `total number of decodings`.


## Time Complexity: `O(n)`
Since we have to iterate through every character in the `input string` and operate a constant number of operations at each character, our runtime is linear, or `O(n)`.

## Space Complexity: `O(1)`
The solution for `s[:i]` is only dependent on `s[:i-1]` and `s[:i-2]`, so we only need to store a constant number of variables for our algorithm, leading to constant space needed.
