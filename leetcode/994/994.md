# Motivation
Since the problem asks us to traverse a 2d matrix and measure the minimum of some value, we should instantly consider bfs as a possible tool for this problem. 

We take the following approach:
* Keep track of `fresh oranges` (by their coordinates) in a set
* Keep track of `rotten oranges` (by their coordinates) and the `amount of time that has passed` in a queue
* Traverse through the grid with bfs through the `rotten oranges` and:
	* remove `fresh oranges` from the set when they're adjacent to the `current rotten orange` we are observing
	* add `newly rotten oranges` (the fresh oranges adjacent to our `current fresh orange`) to the queue with an updated value of the `amount of time that has passed`.
	* if the `number of fresh oranges` is 0, return the time elapsed
	* if queue is empty, and the `number of fresh oranges` is not 0, there are fresh oranges that will never rot, so we return 0
