## Motivation
Since the problem asks us to traverse a 2d matrix and measure the minimum of some value, we should instantly consider bfs as a possible tool for this problem. 

We take the following approach:
* Keep track of `fresh oranges` (by their coordinates) in a set
* Keep track of `rotten oranges` (by their coordinates) and the `amount of time that has passed` in a queue
* Traverse through the grid with bfs through the `rotten oranges` and:
	* remove `fresh oranges` from the set when they're adjacent to the `current rotten orange` we are observing
	* add `newly rotten oranges` (the fresh oranges adjacent to our `current fresh orange`) to the queue with an updated value of the `amount of time that has passed`.
	* if the `number of fresh oranges` is 0, return the time elapsed
	* if queue is empty, and the `number of fresh oranges` is not 0, there are fresh oranges that will never rot, so we return 0

## Time Complexity: `O(n)`
BFS runs in linear time to the graph it traverses. For this problem, the graph we're traversing is the input 2d matrix. Since in worst case we visit every cell in the matrix, our time complexity `O(n)`. 

## Space Complexity: `O(n)`
BFS takes up linear space in the worst case scenario (where the entire cell is filled with rotten oranges), so our space complexity is `O(n)`.
