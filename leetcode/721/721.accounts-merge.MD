# Motivation:
The crux of the problem is to realize the problem can be modeled as a graph. We have each email
represent a node in the graph, while an edge between two nodes represents that the accounts are
owned by the same person. We can easily construct the graph by placing an edge between the first
email in each list in accounts to every other email in the list. For example, if the list were 
['John', 'email1@gmail.com', 'email2@gmail.com', 'email3@gmail.com'], we would create a graph with
and edge between 'email1@gmail.com' and 'email2@gmail.com', and an edge between 'email1@gmail.com' and 
'email3@gmail.com'. Once we go through all of the lists in the accounts argument, if any two emails
are owned by the same person, then there will be a path between the two nodes in our graph. Once
the graph is constructed, we just have to dfs (or bfs) through the graph to generate our list of
emails for each user. 

# Time Complexity:
The time complexity is linear to the input since in worst case every email in the input is unique. 
Note that each email represents a node in the graph we traverse.

# Space Complexity:
The space complexity is linear to the input since in worst case every email in the input is unique.
