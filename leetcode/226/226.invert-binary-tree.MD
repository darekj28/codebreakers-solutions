# Motivation:
Tree problems often lend themselves to recursive solutions since trees themselves have a recursive
structure (their children are also trees). Approaching this problem with a postorder traversal is 
convenient since the problem becomes trivial once the current node's children have already been 
inverted (you just flip the subtrees that the current node's left and right pointers point to).

To explicitly state it, we take the following approach:
1) check our base case and return None if the current node is None
2) invert the left subtree
3) invert the right subtree
4) invert the pointers to the left and right subtree of the current node

# Time Complexity:
The time complexity is linear to the number of nodes in the tree. We must visit every node once to
invert its children.

# Space Complexity:
The space complexity is linear to the height of the tree for the recursive call stack.
