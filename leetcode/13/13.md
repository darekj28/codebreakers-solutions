## Motivation
The key observation is that a `roman character's value` is dependent on the `character's right neighbor's value`. If the `right neighbor's value` is greater, then `the current character's value` is negative, else it is positive. 

Given this, we can easily sum the values of all `characters in the input string` by summing all the `characture values` as we iterate through the `input string`.  

## Time Complexity: `O(len(s))`
We loop through the `input string` once and do a constant amount of work in each iteration, leading to a time complexity linear to the `length of the input string`. 

## Space Complexity: `O(1)`
We use a constant amount of space that does not grow as the `input string` changes.
