## Motivation
We sort the `input array` so we can more easily traverse through triplets. Once the array is sorted, then once we fix one of the items in the `triplet`, the problem reduces to a `sorted two sum`. 

We keep track of the triplet closest to the target as we go through and return the solution after we traverse through all triplets.

## Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`
We iterate through each index in the `input array` and apply `sorted two sum` to `input array[i+1:]`, which takes `O(n)`, leading to a time complexity of `O(n^2)`.

## Space Complexity: `O(1)`
We use a constant amount of memory, so our space complexity is `O(1)`.
