## Motivation
The trick to this problem is to reduce the problem. Once one number in your `quadruplet` is fixed, the problem is reduced to `Three Sum`. Similarly, once another number in the `quadruplet` gets fixed, then the problem is reducecdd to `Two Sum`.  

Initially, we want to sort the `input array`, because this allows us to reduce `Three Sum` into `Sorted Two Sum`, so getting all triplets that sum to some value can be done in `O(n^2)`.

## Time Complexity: `O(n^3)`
Since we use the `Three Sum` algorithm `n-4` times, we have a time complexity of `O(n^3)`.

## Space Complexity: `O(n^4)`
There are `n^4` possible combinations of quadruplets, leading to a space complexity of `O(n^4)`.
