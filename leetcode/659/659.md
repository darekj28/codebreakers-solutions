## Motivation
Due to the sorted nature of the `input array`, we can solve the problem by taking the following approach:

Create a dictionary, `numToCount`, that maps an `element` in the `input array` to their frequency. We use `numToCount[myNum]` to keep track of the number of `myNum`s that still need to be assigned to a subsequence.

Create a dictionary, `tailTocount`, that maps an `element` to the `number of consecutive subsequences that end with the value of the element`. 

Now for each `num` in the `input array`, we see if we can append it to a previously existing subsequence. 

If there is no previously existing subsequence, then we see if we can create a subsequence of size 3 with the remaining available numbers by checking `numToCount` and update `tailToCount` with this new subsequence. 


## Time Complexity: `O(n)`
As we iterate through the `input array`, we never do more than a constant amount of work, leading to a linear time complexity.

## Space Complexity: `O(n)`
We use a `counter` dictionary and `tails` dictionary to store the information we need. The two dictionaries never exceed the length of the input, leading to linear space complexity.
