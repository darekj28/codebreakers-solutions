## Motivation
At each `house i`, we have the option to steal from the `current house i` or skip it. 

If we skip the house, then the `maximum we can steal` is:
	`rob(nums[:i])`.

If we steal from the house, then the `maximum we can steal` is: 
	`rob(nums[:i-1]) + what we can steal from the current house`.

By caching our solutions to these subproblems as we go through the array, we can quickly compute the `max we can steal up to house i`, then return our solution at the end. 

## Time Complexity: `O(n)`
We loop through the entire `input array` once, leading to a linear time complexity of `O(n)`.

## Space Complexity: `O(1)`
We never use more than a constant number of variables, so our space complexity is `O(1)`.
