## Motivation
We take the straightforward approach for this problem by looping through the pairs of nodes in the list and swapping them. 

As we loop through each pair of nodes, it's important to keep track of the `tail` of the linked list that has nodes that are already swapped, so we can link our `newly swapped pair`.

## Time Complexity: `O(n)`
We loop through each node once, leading us to linear time complexity.

## Space Complexity: 'O(1)'
We have a fixed amount of memory we allocate to point to our nodes which are independent of the size of the linked list, so our space complexity is constant.
