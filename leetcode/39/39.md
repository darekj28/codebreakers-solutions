## Motivation
This problem lends itself to backtracking since we're looking for all possible combinations that hit our target sum. We backtrack through the solution space and add all valid combinations to our solution. 

## Time Complexity: `O(k*2^c)`
The time complexity is exponential. There are `2^c` total possible combinations that can be created, where `c` is the length of the `candidates` array. Assuming an average solution of `k`, the time complexity is `O(k*2^c)`.

## Space Complexity: `O(k*2^c)`
Similarly to our time complexity, our space complexity is exponential. In worst case, every combination is a viable solution, leading to a space complexity of `O(k*2^c)`.
