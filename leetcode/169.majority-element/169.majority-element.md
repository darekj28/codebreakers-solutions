## Motivation
The key here is to observe that the majority element is one that appears more than `n/2` times, as opposed to the most frequent element in the list. For instance, take the following two lists of  size 6: `[1,2,3,4,5,5]` and `[1,1,1,2,3,4]`. The second array has a majority element while the first does not. This means that the sum of numbers that are not in the majority will never exceed the majority element, so we can take the following strategy:

1. Select the first element as your candidate.
2. As you iterate through the array, if the current element matches your candidate, increment count
3. Af it does not match, then decremement count. If `count < 0`, the current element becomes the new candidate.

Since the majority element will always be equal or greater than the rest of the elements in the array, your candidate will always be the majority element after looping through the array.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is linear to the length of the array since we loop through it once. `O(n)`

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(1)`. As the size of the input grows, the amount of memory we need for the algorithm does not grow.
