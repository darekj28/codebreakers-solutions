## Motivation
The `longest palindromic subsequence` is equivalent to the `longest common subsequence` of any string `s` and `the reverse of s` due to the reflexive attributes of a palindrome. 

The `longest common subsequence of strings s1 and s2`, or `LCS(s1[:i], s2[:j])`, is reducible to its subproblems `LCS(s1[:i-1],s2[:j-1])`, `LCS(s1[:i-1],s2[:j])`, and `LCS(s1[:i], s2[:j-1])`.

If s1[i] == s2[j], then `LCS(s1[:i], s2[:j])` = `LCS(s1[:i-1], s2[:j-1])` + 1.

If s1[i] != s2[j], then `LCS(s1[:i], s2[:j])` = `max(LCS(s1[:i-1],s2[:j]), LCS(s1[:i], s2[:j-1]))`.

We can solve the problem by building a dynamic programming matrix where `dpMatrix[i][j]` represents the solution for `LCS(s1[:i], s2[:j])`.

## Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`
We iterate through the whole `dp matrix`, which is quadratic relative to `len(s)`, so our time complexity is `O(n^2)`.

## Space Complexity: `O(n^2)`
The `dp matrix` takes quadratic space relative to `len(s)`, so our space complexity is `O(n^2)`.
