## Motivation
Since we want our lists to be ordered with nodes from the top towards the bottom, bfs is a good candidate to traverse our tree. 

As we traverse we need to keep track of the `column` and categorize the `nodes` into their columns. This can be easily done with a `dictionary of lists`, where the `key` is the `column`.

## Time Complexity: `O(n)`
We do a constant amount of operations for each `node` in our `tree` and we must visit each `node` once, leading to `O(n)` time complexity. 

## Space Complexity: `O(n)`
We use a linear amount of space to construct the solution.
