## Motivation
The problem is fairly straightforward: we use a two pointer approach and count the `length of each mountain`, where the two indices represent `the start of the mountain` and the `end of the mountain`. We keep track of the length of the longest mountain as we go through and return it at the end. 

A naive approach would be to select every index in the array as a `potential starting point` for a mountain. However, this leads to a time complexity of `O(n^2)` in the case where the longest mountain spans over the whole array. 

If we observe that a mountain cannot begin in the middle of another mountain, then we can imrpove our runtime significantly to `O(n)`. This is because we end up looping through the array only twice and avoid unneeded computation.

# Time Complexity: `O(n)`
The space complexity is linear to the size of the input since we loop through the array a constant number of times.

# Space Complexity: `O(1)`
The space complexity is constant to the size of the input.
