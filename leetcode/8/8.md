## Motivation
The problem is fairly straightforward. We must loop through the `characters` of the `input string` and:
	* skip all initial white spaces
	* grab the `sign` of the potential integer to be created
	* grab only the `valid digits` and place them in a `stringbuffer`
where the `valid digits` are defined as a set of contiguous digits that occurs immediately after all initial `blank space characters` and at most `one sign character`.

Once we convert our `stringbuffer` into an integer with the correct `sign`, we just have to check if it is within the bounds of a 32 bit signed integer and return the desired object specified in the problem.

## Time Complexity: `O(n)`
In worst case, we loop through every `character` in our `input string`, leading to a linear time complexity.

## Space Complexity: `O(n)`
In worst case, every `character` in our `input string` is a valid digit, leading us to use linear space in our `stringbuffer`.
