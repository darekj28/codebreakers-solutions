## Motivation
The problem is relatively straightforward. We loop through the matrix and count all of the current cell's neighbors. Then we store its number of neighbors in an auxillary matrix. We provide a solution in linear space because we assume that the contents of the cells should be 0,1 bits as opposed to integers. If one wanted to update the matrix without an auxillary matrix, they would have to replace the current cell of the board with a code that represents both the previous state and next state of the board (so that the current cell's neighbors would be able to count their own neighbors properly). To do this, it would require linear space since integers require multiple bits. Note that if the board were infinite, we would be required to solve the problem in blocks, potentially row by row. One could also take advantage of sparseness, and only store the location of live cells in the matrix if only a few are alive relative to the size of the board.

## Time Complexity: `O(n*m)`
The time complexity is linear to the size of the matrix since we loop through a constant number of times. We visit each cell in the board a constant number of times: once when calculating the number of neighbors it has, up to 8 times for counting a neighboring cell's number of neighbors, and once again to update all the values in the matrix. 

## Space Complexity: `O(n*m)`
The space complexity is linear to the input since our neighbors matrix is the same size.
