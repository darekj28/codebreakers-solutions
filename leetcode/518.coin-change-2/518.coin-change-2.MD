## Motivation
This problem lends itself to dynamic programming since `num_ways(amount)` can be broken down as a function of its subproblems. A good approach for finding the pattern would be to try solving the problem when the `amount` to be created is small and the `coins` list is small. 

Consider the problem: `amount = 10, coins = [1,5,10]`

This problem is tricky because the state of our subproblem is dependent on two things: the `amount` __and__ `the set of coins we are using to generate amount` from `coins`! Many people mistakingly assume that you can just add the missing coin `c` to each of the piles in `num_ways(amount-c)`, but as you will see this approach ends up overcounting.

Let's take the following as an example: `amount = 10, coins = [1,5,10]` 

It's important to notice that :

`num_ways(10) != num_ways(10-1) + num_ways(10-5) + num_ways(10-10)`

or more formally:

`num_ways(amount) != sum(num_ways(amount-c) for all c in coins)`

For this particular example:

`num_ways(9) = 2` using the sets `[(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1), (1,1,1,1,5)]`, 
`num_ways(5) = 2` using the sets `[(1,1,1,1,1), (5)]`, and 
`num_ways(0) = 1` using the set `[()]`

This leads to an incorrect solution of 5, while the correct solution is 4. This is because you end up double counting by adding `1` to the pile `(1,1,1,1,5)` from `num_ways(9)` and adding `5` to the pile `(1,1,1,1,1)` from `num_ways(5)`. 

In order to avoid double counting, we can instead build our solution by first answering the question: 

How many ways can I build my `amount` with only `coins[:i]`  for `0 <= i < len(coins)`? 

More formally, the recurrence relation for this problem is: 

`num_ways(n,i) = sum(num_ways(n-c,i-1)) for all c in coins[:i]) for 0 <= i < len(coins)` 

The relation holds since this approach "forces the order of the coins" and allows us to avoid double dounting as we "generate piles" for our final solution `num_ways(amount)`.

Given this recurrence relationship, we can use dynamic programming to store the solutions of the subproblems in an array to efficiently compute our solution.

# Time Complexity: `O(n*c)`
The time complexity is `O(n*c)`  where n is the `amount` we are trying to generate and c is the number of `coins`.

# Space Complexity: `O(n)`
The space complexity is linear to the `amount` since we create a dp matrix to hold the solutions to the subproblems.
