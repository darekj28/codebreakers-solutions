## Motivation
The convention when constructing a `roman numeral` is to use the largest possible symbols when possible. 

Given this, we can convert our integer using a greedy approach: iterating through all the possible `roman values` and picking the largest option from left to right. We continue this process until the `sum of all roman values` equals our `input integer`.

## Time Complexity: `O(len(s))`
We loop through the `input string` once and do a constant amount of work in each iteration, leading to a time complexity linear to the `length of the input string`. 

## Space Complexity: `O(1)`
We use a constant amount of space that does not grow as the `input string` changes.
