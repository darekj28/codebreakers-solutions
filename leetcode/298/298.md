## Motivation
We take a recursive approach to the problem due to the recursive structures of trees. 

At each `node`, we count the `length of the current consecutive sequence` ending at the `current node`. Then we pass down this value and the `parent node's value` to its `children`, so they can do the same.

If the `parent's node value != current node's value - 1`, then we set the `consecutive sequence length ending at the current node` to 1.

If the `current node` is `None`, then we return 0. Else, we return `max(length of current consecutive sequence, result from left child, result from right child)`. This results in the `longest length of all consecutive sequences` getting passed up to the `root` of the tree.

## Time Complexity: `O(n)`
We visit every node once in our recursive traversal of the tree, leading to a linear run time.

## Space Complexity: `O(h)`
The recursive call stack takes up to the height of the tree.
