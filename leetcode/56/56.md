# Motivation
Note that if the input is sorted, then the `intervals` that intersect each other become neighbors. Once the `intervals list` is sorted, we can iterate through the `intervals` and take the following approach:
* initialize our `solution` with the `first interval` from our input, then iterate throug the rest of the input
* if the `last interval in our solution` and `current interval` do not intersect, then append the current interval to our `solution`
* if the `last interval` and `current interval` do intersect:
	* if the current interval is encapsulated by the last interval, continue to the next interval
	* else, edit the end of the `last interval in our solution` to end where the `current interval` ends
