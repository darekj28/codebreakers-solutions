## Motivation
We can approach the problem by simulating the push and pop sequence implied by the inputs `pushed` and `popped`. 

The key observation is to note that if our `simulation stack` is ever capable of popping the `next value to be popped`, then we must do so immediately. This is because if we push another element to the `simulation stack`, then we will never have another opportunity to pop the `next value to be popped` since every element in the stack is unique. 

The simulation is structured as follows:
	For each element in `pushed`:
		add the element to our `simulation stack`
		while `simulation stack's` top element matches the `next value to pop`:
			pop the top element from simulation stack
	return True if our `simulation stack` is empty

## Time Complexity: `O(n)`
In worst case, we push every element in `pushed` into our `simulation stack` and pop all the elements out of it. This leads to a linear time complexity.

## Space Complexity: `O(n)`
We store up to the size of the input array `pushed` in our `simulation array`, leading to a linear space complexity.
