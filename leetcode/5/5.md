## Motivation
Within the input `string`, there are `2*len(string)-1` possible `center points` for the palindrome. `len(string)` number of odd potential palindromes, and `len(string)-1` number of potential even palindromes.

We can find all the palindromes in the input `string` by starting at each one of these `center points` and expand our `starting and ending indices` of the palindrome outwards. We merely keep track of the indices that map to the longest palindrome as we go through the potential `center points` and return the substring using those indices at the end.

# Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`
The time complexity is quadratic to the size of the input since in the worst case. Consider the case when every candidate for the center of our palindrome expands to the end of the string. In this case, the palindromes have an average length of n/2, so our runtime is (n/2)*n, leading to `O(n^2)`

# Space Complexity: `O(1)`
The space complexity is constant to the size of the input.
