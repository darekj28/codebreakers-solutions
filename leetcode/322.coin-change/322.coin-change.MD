## Motivation
This problem lends itself to dynamic programming since it's very easy to solve the number of ways of creating an `amount` if you know the number of ways to create any amount smaller. A good approach for finding the pattern would be to try solving the problem when the `amount` to be created is small and the `coins` list is small. 

For example, let the `amount` be 10 and the `coins` list to be `[1,2,5]`. If you know the solution for `amount` equals 9, 8, and 5, then you've solved the problem! Take a moment if you needed to convince yourself that it is the minimum # of ways to generate amount - c for c in `coins` + 1. For this particular case, you can generate 9 with 3 coins (5,2,2), 8 with 3 coins (5,2,1), and 5 with 1 coin (5). The minimum number of coins needed out for this particular case is 1 (generating the sum 5 with the coin 5). Now we add 1 to it (for the additional coin we'll need to have the amount sum to 10) to get our solution 2.

# Time Complexity: `O(n*c)`
The time complexity is `O(n*c)`  where n is the `amount` we are trying to generate and c is the number of `coins`.

# Space Complexity: `O(n)`
The space complexity is linear to the `amount` since we create a dp matrix to hold the solutions to the subproblems.
