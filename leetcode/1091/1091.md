## Motivation
We want to traverse a 2d matrix and want the shortest path, immediately we should think of bfs. If we bfs through the `matrix` and keep track of the `distance we've traveled so far`, then once we reach the `destination` we return the `distance traveled`.

## Time Complexity: `O(r*c)`
In worst case, we travel through every single cell in the `2d matrix`, so our time complexity is linear to the `input matrix`, or `O(r*c)`, where `r` is the number of rows and `c` is the number of columns. 

## Space Complexity: `O(r+c)`
BFS has the time complexity of `O(r+c)` in a 2d matrix, where `r` is the number of rows and `c` is the number of columns.
