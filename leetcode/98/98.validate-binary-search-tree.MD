# Motivation:
Tree problems often lend themselves to recursive solutions since trees themselves have a recursive
structure (their children are also trees). We must take a preorder traversal since the current 
node's value determines the bounds of its children. 

For this problem, we take the following approach:
1) check if the current node's value is within the proper bounds (initialized as -math.inf to 
math.inf)
2) check if its children's values are within the proper bounds
3) if both our children are valid, we return True. 

Note that our base case is when the current node is None, in which we return True.

# Time Complexity:
The time complexity is linear to the number of nodes in the tree. We must visit every node once to
check if they are all valid.

# Space Complexity:
The space complexity is linear to the height of the tree for the recursive call stack.
