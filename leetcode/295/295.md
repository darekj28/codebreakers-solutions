## Motivation
Since we want to get the `median` in constant time, we need to be able to get `the middle two elements of the stream` in constant time: 
* If the `total number of elements seen so far` is even, we have to take the mean of the `two middle elements` to get our `median`.
* If the `total number of elements seen so far` is odd, then the `median` is just one of `the middle two elements of the stream`.

This is easily done if we split the numbers we've seen into two groups: `all the numbers greater than or equal to the median` and `all numbers less than the median`. By storing the elements of these groups into a heap, we can quickly retreive the values we need to compute our `median`.

## Time Complexity
The get median method uses a constant number of operations, leading to a time complexity of `O(1)`.
The add number method involves pushing and popping values from a heap, leading to a time complexity of `O(log(n))`, where `n` is the total amount of numbers added.

## Space Complexity
The get median method uses a constant number of variables, leading to a space complexity of `O(1)`.
The add number method uses a constant number of variables, leading to a space complexity of `O(1)`.
