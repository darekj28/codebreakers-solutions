# Motivation
Since we want to get the `median` in constant time, we need to be able to get `the middle two elements of the stream` in constant time: 
* If the `total number of elements seen so far` is even, we have to take the mean of the `two middle elements` to get our `median`.
* If the `total number of elements seen so far` is odd, then the `median` is just one of `the middle two elements of the stream`.

This is easily done if we split the numbers we've seen into two groups: `all the numbers greater than or equal to the median` and `all numbers less than the median`. By storing the elements of these groups into a heap, we can quickly retreive the values we need to compute our `median`.
