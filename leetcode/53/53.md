## Motivation
The key to this problem is to consider the maximum subarray sum ending at `i` for each index `i` in the input array, where the `ith value in the array` is included in the `subarray sum`. Since these subarrays are contiguous, it will either be the value itself (in the case that the `subarray sum for the index i-1 <= 0`, or we're considering the base case where we consider the index `i = 0`), or the `ith value + the previous subarray sum`. Once we realize this, we merely have to keep track of the `max sum` as we move through the array and return it at the end. 

# Time Complexity: `O(n)`
The time complexity is linear to the size of the input array since we have to calculate the subarray sum for all indices in the input.

# Space Complexity: `O(1)`
The space complexity is constant since the variables we have to maintain to solve the algorithm is constant.
