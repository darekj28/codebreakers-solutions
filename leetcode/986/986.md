# Motivation
Since the inputs `A` and `B` are sorted already, it's relatively straightforward to find all the intersections. We simply iterate through both lists from the beginning and check if the `current intervals` are intersecting. Since the lists are sorted, we know the shorter of the two intervals cannot intersect with any other interval we haven't seen yet. 

Our solution takes the following approach:
* check if the two intervals intersect
* if they intersect, we append the intersection to our solution
* increment the `index` of the list whose interval is shorter
