# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
     def __init__(self, x):
         self.val = x
         self.next = None
```

# Motivation
Since the list is already ordered so the least significant digits come first, (the ones digits are the head, the head points to the tens digits, the tens digits point to the hundreds digits, etc) a straightforward strategy is to just loop through both lists 1 node at a time and sum them to find the value of our solution's corresponding node for that digit. (Taking the list `1->9->2` to represent 291 and `4->4->4` as 444 for example, to get the 1's digit for our solution, we merely need to sum 1 and 4 to get 5.) If the sum of the two node values exceed 9, then we must only use the the 1's digit in the sum and store the remainder for the next pair of nodes to be summed. 

# Run-Time Complexity
The time complexity is linear in the number of nodes in the longer list, since we have to go through each digit.

# Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(max(length of l1, length of l2))`. The most nodes you'll ever make is the number of digits in the longer list + 2 (1 for the dummy head and 1 if there's an extra remainder from the sum).
