## Motivation
Immediately upon inspection of the problem, we should observe that our solution should take advantage of the sorted properties of the matrix to achieve a solution that would be reasonable for interviews. (The naive solution of searching through the matrix linearly defeats the purpose of the problem.) Here the trick is to start your search at either the bottom left corner or top right corner fo the matrix. By starting at the "extreme points" of the matrix, we can cut the space we are searching through for the target very easily. Take the bottom left corner for example: if the target is greater than the value, then the target (if in the matrix) must involve a column to  the right, since all values in the current row are also too small. Similarly, if the target is smaller than the value in the bottom left corner, then the solution cannot involve the current column or any column to its left. 

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is linear to the number of rows and columns in the matrix should the target not exist in the matrix. `O(r*c)`

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is constamt since we only use a few variables for the algorithm. `O(1)`
