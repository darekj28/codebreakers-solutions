## Motivation
Let `LIS(nums[:i+1])` represent the longest increasing subsequence that ends in nums[i]

If we know `LIS(nums[:j+1]) for all j < i`, then:

`LIS(nums[:i]) = max(LIS(nums[:j+1]) for all j < i) + 1`

Since calculating `LIS(nums[:j])` requires solutions from overlapping subproblems, this problem is a great candidate for dynamic programming.

We can have a `dpArray` where `dpArray[i]` represents the solution for`LIS(nums[:i+1])` where our subsequence ends with `nums[i]`. 

For each index `i`, we find the maximum length of increasing subsequences which end at a value < `nums[i]` by looping through `dpArray[:i]`. Once we find the max, we simply increment the value by 1 to account for the new addition to our increasing subsequence, `nums[i]`.

Once we finish creating our `dpArray`, we return `max(dpArray)` as our solution.

## Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`
To create our `dpArray` we make n loops. At each iteration of the loops, we do at most n additional loops. This leads to a quadratic time complexity of `O(n^2)`.

## Space Complexity: `O(n)`
It costs us linear space to create our `dpArray`, so our space complexity is `O(n)`.
