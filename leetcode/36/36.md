## Motivation
We use sets to keep track of the `numbers we've seen` for every `row`, `column`, and `box`. 

We also loop through every `cell` in the `input matrix` and if we've already seen a value before in the same `row`, `column`, or `box`, then we know that the `input matrix` is invalid.

We map indices to boxes of the following location in the `input matrix` as follows:

[7, 8, 9
 4, 5, 6
 1, 2, 3]

This leads to an easy mapping between the `current cell's rows and columns` to `box indices` with the following relationship:

`box index = row//3*3 + col//3`

Once we finish iterating through all the cells, if there were no errors, then our `input matrix` is valid!

## Time Complexity: `O(1)`
The time complexity is constant since we're guaranteed that the input is a 9 by 9 matrix and the number of computations is capped by the number of cells in the matrix/

## Space Complexity: `O(1)`
The space complexity is constant since we're guaranteed that the input is a 9 by 9 matrix, and we won't allocate more space than that of the input.
