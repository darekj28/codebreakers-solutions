# Motivation
An array provides all the functionality we need to simulate a normal stack. The main point of this problem is to construct a system for getting the minimum value in the stack in constant time. 

For situations, such as this, where the minimum or maximum of a range is wanted in constant time, the use of a `monotonic stack` is very helpful. The idea is we only append values to our `monotonic stack` if it represents the minimum at some point in the `main stack` containing all our values. We only pop values off of our `monotonic stack` if its corresponding value is being popped off of the `main stack`. This ensure that the top of the `monotonic stack` always has the minimum of all the values in the `main stack`.
