## Motivation
Despite the array not being completely sorted, we are still capable of taking advantage of its partially sorted nature using binary search. 

At every iteration of binary search, one portion of the array will be sorted, while the other isn't guaranteed to be (It is still sorted if the array is shifted a product of the length of the array). We can check to see if our target is within the guaranteed sorted portion of the array. If it is, then we change our search space to the sorted portion. Else, we direct our search space to the (potentially) unsorted portion of the array. 

## Time Complexity: `O(log(n))`
The time complexity is logarithmic to the size of the array since we cut our search space in half with each iteration of the loop.

## Space Complexity: `O(1)`
The space complexity is constant to the size of the array.
