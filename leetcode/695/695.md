## Motivation
The crux of the problem is to model the 2d grid as a graph. Each cell is a node and there is an edge between two cells if they are adjacent and both contain the value 1. The problem can be reduced to counting the number of nodes in each graph and keeping track of the largest graph. We can count the number of nodes in each graph with either BFS or DFS.

# Time Complexity: `O(r*c)`
The time complexity is linear to the input since we have a constant number of operations per cell.

# Space Complexity: `O(r*c)`
The space complexity is linear to the input matrix since the recursive call stack takes up the whole matrix in the case where the whole grid is an island.
