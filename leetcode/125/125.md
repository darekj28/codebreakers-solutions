## Motivation
To check if a `string` is a valid palindrome, we merely need to check if it is symmetric. For this specific version of the problem, we are asked to skip all values that aren't alphanumeric. This is easily accomplished by using two pointers, `leftIndex` and `rightIndex`, which are initialized at the ends of the input `string` and walking them towards the center of the `string`. As we iterate through the string, we must check to ensure that the values at each index equal each other. 

## Time Complexity: `O(n)`
We have to visit every character in the string to check if the input is a palindrome, so the best we can do is `O(n)`.

## Space Complexity: `O(1)`
We use a constant number of pointers to produce our solution, so our space complexity is constant.
