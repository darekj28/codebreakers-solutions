## Motivation
We work outwards towards the center and check if the `characters` in the `input string` equal each other. 

If the `characters` don't match for the first time, then for each of the characters:
* remove the character from the string
* see if the remaining string is a valid palindrome

Else, we return False.

## Time Complexity: `O(n)`
At most, we traverse through the input string 3 times, leading to a linear time complexity.

## Space Complexity: `O(1)`
We use a constant number of variables, and we won't ever delete characters more than twice, so our space complexity is constant.
