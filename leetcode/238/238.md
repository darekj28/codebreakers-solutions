## Motivation
Since division is not allowed, we can construct our solution for each index `i` if we know:
* the product of all elements in `nums[:i]`
* the product of all elements in `nums[i+1:]`

We can keep track of the `running products` from both the right and left then we can construct our solution. This works since our solution for each index `i` is `product(nums[:i])*product(nums[1+1:])`.

We can store the `running product from left to right` in the `output array`, then as we calculate the `running product from right to left` we can update our `output array` to the final solution.

## Time Complexity: `O(n)`
Since we have to loop through the `input array` twice, our time complexity is linear.

## Space Complexity: `O(n)`
We need to allocate space for our `output` which is the same length as our `input array`, so our space complexity is also linear.
